**Basic Website Design With HTML &amp; CSS**

I've made a "design your home" themed website interface.
 
This project was made while learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript. 

*In this project:*

ðŸ”¶HTML

ðŸ”¶CSS 

is used.

In this project, which consists of only the homepage design, I preferred to use the green color in my navbar, logo and button. 
The green color I use is **#556b2f**

This project consists of a navbar consisting of "home, bedroom, dining, kitchen, backyard sections.
In addition, it consists of a heading, a paragraph and a button.

Transition effect is used in the navbar and button. And this is set to 0.5s.

The photo is taken from pinterest.

The project is uploaded as a zip&rar. You can download logo, photo and source code. Thank you!
